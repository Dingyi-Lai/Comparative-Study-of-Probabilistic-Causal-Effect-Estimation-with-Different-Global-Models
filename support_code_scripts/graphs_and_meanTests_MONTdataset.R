# MEAN DIFFERENCE TESTING

## 1. Preparing the data

## treated group
diff_I <- subset(forecastfull_total_ds_TR, DATE >= '2020-01-01', select=c(DATE, TOTAL))
diff_I$Y <- subset(observed_data_total_ds_TR, DATE >= '2020-01-01', select=c(TOTAL))
diff_I$ab_diff <- abs(diff_I$TOTAL - diff_I$Y)
diff_I$ab_sum_av <- (abs(diff_I$TOTAL) + abs(diff_I$Y))/2
diff_I$ab_diff_propY <- (diff_I$ab_diff) / (diff_I$Y)
diff_I$ab_diff_propT <- (diff_I$ab_diff) / (diff_I$TOTAL)
diff_I$ab_diff_propYF <- (diff_I$ab_diff) / (diff_I$ab_sum_av)

## control group
diff_NI <- subset(forecastfull_total_ds_CR, DATE >= '2020-01-01', select=c(DATE, TOTAL))
diff_NI$Y <- subset(observed_data_total_ds_CR, DATE >= '2020-01-01', select=c(TOTAL))
diff_NI$ab_diff <- abs(diff_NI$TOTAL - diff_NI$Y)
diff_NI$ab_sum_av <- (abs(diff_NI$TOTAL) + abs(diff_NI$Y))/2
diff_NI$ab_diff_propY <- (diff_NI$ab_diff) / (diff_NI$Y)
diff_NI$ab_diff_propT <- (diff_NI$ab_diff) / (diff_NI$TOTAL)
diff_NI$ab_diff_propYF <- (diff_NI$ab_diff) / (diff_NI$ab_sum_av)

## 2. MEAN SIGNIFICANCE TESTS FOR relative differences
diff_I_vec <- as.vector(unlist(diff_I$ab_diff_propT))*100
diff_NI_vec <- as.vector(unlist(diff_NI$ab_diff_propT))*100

cat(mean(diff_I_vec), median(diff_I_vec))
cat(mean(diff_NI_vec), median(diff_NI_vec))

# Shapiro-Wilkâ€™s test for normality
shapiro.test(diff_I_vec) # if p-value > 0.05, so data are not significantly different from normal distribution. In other words, we can assume the normality.
shapiro.test(diff_NI_vec) # if p-value > 0.05, so data are not significantly different from normal distribution. In other words, we can assume the normality.

# Results are p-value = 0.8844 and p-value = 0.9045, so in this dataset the distribution of the relative differences follows 
# normal distribution, so we need to apply the t-test instead of Wilcoxon signed-rank exact test.

t.test(x=diff_I_vec, y=diff_NI_vec, paired = TRUE) # if p-value < 0.05, the difference between means is significant. In other words, the means are statistically different.
wilcox.test(diff_I_vec, diff_NI_vec, paired = TRUE) # if p-value < 0.05, the difference between means is significant. In other words, the means are statistically different.

# result of t-test --> p-value = 0.004604 < 0.05, so the distribution of errors are statistically different
# result of wilcox test --> p-value = 0.01563 < 0.05 so the distribution of errors are statistically different
