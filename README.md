## Summary

The estimation of causal effects becomes increasingly complex when interventions exert diverse influences across quantiles. Addressing this challenge, we introduce a novel global framework that seamlessly integrates causal analysis with prediction algorithms. Despite remaining theoretical gaps, we propose a standardized approach to answer this research question. This involves defining causal mechanisms via directed acyclic graphs, elucidating theoretical assumptions, conducting placebo tests to identify causal effects, and estimating probabilistic causal effects within the global causal framework. Through comparative analysis utilizing synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate the potential of this framework to estimate varying causal effects across quantiles over time. While promising, ongoing refinement is necessary to enhance the framework's consistency and robustness.

## Reproducing results

### Data preprocessing code
We have used two datasets for the experiments of this paper:
1) **Synthetic Dataset:**

The synthetic dataset comprises 24 scenarios for generation, varying from short time series (with a length of 60) to long time series (with a length of 222). These scenarios range from homogeneous intervention over 0.9 quantiles (adding one unit standard deviation of treated units before intervention) to heterogeneous intervention over 0.9 quantiles (adding a random number between 0.7 to 1.5, multiplied by one unit standard deviation of treated units before intervention).

Furthermore, the dataset spans from a few time series (10 in total), medium time series (101 in total) to many time series (500 in total), and from a linear data generation process (autoregressive regression, i.e., AR) to a nonlinear structure (self-exciting threshold autoregressive, i.e., SETAR).

The codes for simulation and exploratory data analysis are located in `src/prepare_source_data/sim/simulation.rmd`, with its HTML version available at `simulation.html`. The original data for simulation is situated in `./data/text_data/sim/unrate.txt`, accessible from Data_USEconModel in MATLAB.

For DeepProbCP, the dataset undergoes preprocessing using a window moving strategy, implemented in `src/prepare_source_data/sim/preprocessing_layer.R`. This aligns with the original codes from Grecov et al. for DeepCPNet. Subsequently, `src/prepare_source_data/sim/create_tfrecords.py` facilitates the creation of data in the tfrecords format to enhance computational efficiency, a method also employed in the previous codes for DeepCPNet. The customized module "tfrecords_handler" is also available in `src/models/DeepProbCP`.

2) **The 911 Emergency Calls Dataset for Montgomery County**

This dataset, sourced from Kaggle, contains records of 911 emergency calls from Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, USA, spanning from December 2015 to July 2020. The raw data file, named "911.csv," is available for download from the following https://www.kaggle.com/mchirico/montcoalert.

**Exploratory Data Analysis:**
- The exploratory data analysis is documented in `src/prepare_source_data/calls911/EDA.ipynb`.

**Data Wrangling:**
- To process the data, the script `src/prepare_source_data/calls911/calls911_wrangling_code.R` is utilized for tasks such as splitting, formatting, and cleaning.
- The resulting output data should ideally be stored in `./data/text_data/calls911/calls3.csv`. However, due to size limitations on GitHub, this file has been removed from the current repository.

**Preprocessing:**
- Further preprocessing steps are conducted using `src/prepare_source_data/calls911/calls911_to_forecasting_code.R`.
- The full monthly dataset is available in `./data/text_data/calls911/calls911_month_full.txt`, while the training dataset spans from December 2015 to December 2019 and is stored in `./data/text_data/calls911/calls911_month_train.txt`. The testing dataset spans from January 2020 to July 2020 and is stored in `./data/text_data/calls911/calls911_month_test.txt`.
- To address the training and testing datasets in subsequent steps, scripts `src/prepare_source_data/calls911/adjustOrigTrainDtSet.R` and `src/prepare_source_data/calls911/adjustOrigTestDtSet.R` are utilized. The resulting output files are named `callsMT2_train.csv` and `callsMT2_test_actual.csv`, serving as the training and testing datasets, respectively.

**For DeepProbCP:**
- The dataset undergoes preprocessing using a window moving strategy after being transformed to tfrecords by `src/prepare_source_data/calls911/create_tfrecords.py`.
- These preprocessing steps are implemented in `src/prepare_source_data/calls911/mean_stl_train_validation_withoutEXvar.R` and `src/prepare_source_data/calls911/mean_stl_test_withoutEXvar.R`.

**For Other Models:**
- The script `src/prepare_source_data/calls911/benchmarks.py` is utilized to convert `calls911_month_full.txt` to a standardized input format, resulting in `./data/text_data/calls911/calls911_benchmarks.csv`.

### Training code

To train the model(s) in the paper, for

1) Causal Impact
Run the codes in `src/models/CausalImpact/causalimpact.ipynb`

2) TSMixer
Run the codes in `src/models/TSMixer/tsmixer.ipynb`

3) DeepProbCP
Run the codes in `src/models/DeepProbCP/DeepProbCP.sh`

The model expects a number of arguments.
1. dataset_type - synthetic or real-world dataset
2. dataset_name - Any unique string for the name of the dataset
3. contain_zero_values - Whether the dataset contains zero values(0/1)
4. forecast_horizon - The forecast horizon of the dataset
5. no_of_series - The number of series of the dataset
6. optimizer - The type of the optimizer(cocob/adam/adagrad)
7. seasonality_period - The seasonality period of the time series
8. address_near_zero_instability - Whether the dataset contains zero values(0/1) - Whether to use a custom SMAPE function to address near zero instability(0/1). Default value is 0
9. without_stl_decomposition - Whether not to use stl decomposition(0/1). Default is 0

4) TFT
The codes in `src/models/TSMixer/tft_colab.ipynb` should be run in Colab instead, which is more likely to success in installing modules

### Evaluation code

There are three parts for evaluation.

1) The sMAPE, MASE and CRPS in the post-treatment period for the control and the treated (if the data is synthetic)

This is achieved during the modelling process, and the results are stored in `results/.../accuracy`

2) The average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) in the post-treatment period for the treated and the sMAPE of ATT (if the data is synthetic)

This is executed in `src/evaluation/results.ipynb`, and the resultes are in `results/.../tte`

3) Placebo Test
This is conducted and presented in `src/evaluation/results.ipynb`

### Pretrained models

Pretrained models for DeepProbCP are in `results/calls911/DeepProbCP/pkl` and for TFT are in `results/calls911/TFT/pkl`

## Results

The main figures that are used in the thesis and the talk are in `figures`. For example, EDA_911.png is generated via `src/prepare_source_data/calls911/EDA.ipynb`. The others are mostly built in `src/evaluation/results.ipynb`. The numbers in tables are in `results`
