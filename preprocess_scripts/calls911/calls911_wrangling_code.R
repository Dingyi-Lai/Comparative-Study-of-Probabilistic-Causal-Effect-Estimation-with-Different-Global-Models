## DATA WRANGLING process through the 911 emergency calls for Montgomery County - PA - USA

### Loading Data: the raw data was downloaded from this source:
### Dataset from Kaggle containing the 911 emergency calls from Montgomery County (Pennsylvania-USA) from Dec/2015, 
### and retrieved from https://www.kaggle.com/mchirico/montcoalert.

# libraries
library(stringr)
library(dplyr)

# After downloaded the raw data to my local machine (and naming it as '911.csv'), the following code was applied in order to wrangle the raw data.

# Loading the data
calls <- read.csv('911.csv', header=T, na.strings=c(""," ", "NA"))

# From this 293 missings, for 124 of them we have information about the zip, and from these 124 zips, 102 are unique lat/lon/zips. 
# As the task to fill the `twp` column searching for those 102 lat/lon/zips would be very time consuming, and the amount of 
# those missings are not representative, I've decided to clean these missings from the dataset.
